# ChronoFi - ETH Bangkok Hackathon 2024

## **Project Title**: ChronoFi

### **Problem Statement**

In traditional finance (TradFi), automated recurring payments play a critical role in managing loans, subscriptions, investments, and savings. They offer users frictionless, scheduled payments that reduce missed deadlines and improve financial planning.  
However, the Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems lack infrastructure for automated, trustless recurring transactions. Currently, users must manually initiate each DeFi investment, service payment, or recurring financial commitment, creating inefficiencies and limiting DeFi's growth potential.

### **ChronoFi Solution**

ChronoFi introduces **automated, decentralized recurring payments** to the DeFi ecosystem. By bridging the gap between Web3 and TradFi, ChronoFi enables seamless management of subscriptions, loan repayments, yield farming contributions, and more.  
This solution enhances user experience, increases retention, and unlocks new opportunities for DeFi applications by eliminating manual processes and reducing missed commitments.

### **Core Components of ChronoFi**

#### **1. Flexible Payment Scheduling**

- Users can automate recurring payments for DeFi activities like staking, yield farming, and liquidity provision.
- Payments are scheduled with user-defined frequencies (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually).
- ChronoFi’s backend autonomously initiates transactions, enhancing portfolio management across protocols without user intervention.

#### **2. Decentralized Solver Network**

- ChronoFi leverages a decentralized network of **"Solver" nodes** to execute transactions autonomously.
- This ensures the system is trustless, transparent, and permissionless.

#### **3. Trustless Consensus via Threshold Key Sharing**

- Advanced cryptography (threshold key sharing) secures transaction execution.
- Each Solver holds a fragment of the key, and **50%+ consensus among Solvers** is required to authorize payments.
- This model eliminates single points of failure and ensures secure, decentralized operations.

#### **4. $CHRONO Token for Incentives**

- The **$CHRONO** token incentivizes Solver nodes.
- Solvers earn $CHRONO for executing payments, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem.
- Tokenomics ensures reliable and timely Solver participation, bolstering network stability.

#### **5. On-Chain Transparency and Audibility**

- All payment actions, from execution to Solver rewards, are recorded on-chain.
- Users gain **real-time visibility** into the lifecycle of their payments, enhancing trust and transparency.

### **Benefits of ChronoFi’s Solution**

#### **1. Frictionless Financial Automation**

- ChronoFi eliminates the manual overhead of managing recurring DeFi payments.
- Reduces missed deadlines, lowering user attrition and boosting adoption.

#### **2. Structured Financial Growth**

- Enables consistent contributions to staking, yield farming, and savings.
- Aligns with long-term financial goals, maximizing returns through automation.

#### **3. Trustless Execution and Security**

- Decentralized Solver nodes and threshold consensus prevent centralized control over funds.
- Ensures secure, trustless transaction execution.

#### **4. Solver Network Incentives with $CHRONO**

- $CHRONO token rewards motivate Solver engagement and high performance.
- Supports a decentralized, stable, and reliable DeFi protocol.

### **Solver Network Architecture**

ChronoFi's decentralized Solver network guarantees secure and resilient payment execution:

- **Threshold Key Sharing**: Each Solver node holds a fragment of the cryptographic key.
- **Consensus Model**: A **50%+ majority** is required to validate and execute payments.
- **Rewards**: Solvers are rewarded in $CHRONO tokens for successful transaction execution.

This architecture ensures:

- **Security**: No single Solver can act maliciously without consensus.
- **Reliability**: Incentives ensure robust Solver participation.
- **Decentralization**: Operates without reliance on central authorities, upholding Web3 principles.

### **ChronoFi - Empowering DeFi Automation**

By combining automated payments, trustless consensus, and a decentralized incentive model, ChronoFi revolutionizes Web3 and DeFi, delivering TradFi-like convenience with unparalleled security and transparency.

**Let’s reshape the future of DeFi with ChronoFi!**
